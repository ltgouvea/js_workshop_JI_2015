// • require(): This method is used to load the module into your code.
// • exports: This object is contained in each module and allows you to expose
// pieces of your code when the module is loaded.
// • module: This object was originally used to provide metadata information
// about the module. It also contains the pointer of an exports object as a
// property. However, the popular implementation of the exports object as a
// standalone object literally changed the use case of the module object.
